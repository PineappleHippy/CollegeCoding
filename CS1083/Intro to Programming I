Learning Goals
At the end of the course, you will be able to:

Identify programming terminology and obtain a solid grasp of the basic mechanics of programming.
Use programming techniques to solve everyday problems.
Determine which programming techniques are used in different type of problems.
Write reasonably correct Java code, without the help of an IDE, so that their programming skills can be evaluated in exams.
Write simple programs. Examples include: computing the area or volume of a shape given the formula, translating between units (e.g., miles to kilometers), counting the iterations of a while loop, taking unstructured input inside a loop and producing tabular output, or summing the values in an array.
Show the trace the execution of code fragments, particularly simple cases such as keeping track of the values of variables through a short series of computations, including branches, loops, and method calls.
